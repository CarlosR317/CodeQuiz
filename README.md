# CodeQuiz: I created an html and js file that held my code and created all new code to create the code quiz with 10 questions and a timer, when ever the user gets a question wrong than 5 seconds will be removed from the overall allowed time. I made the 10 questions and the different responses (A, B, C, or D) that the user can pick from. The user only sees one question at a time and once a response is picked they are then directed to the next page with a new question. User can see previous scores and reset their scores as well as inputting their initials.
