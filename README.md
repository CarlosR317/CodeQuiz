# CodeQuiz: I created an html and js file that held my code and created all new code to create the code quiz with 10 questions and a timer, when ever the user gets a question wrong than 5 seconds will be removed from the overall allowed time. I made the 10 questions and the different responses that the user can pick from. The user only sees one question at a time and once a response is picked they are then directed to the next page with a new question. The user is supposed to be able to see their previous scores and reset their scores as well as inputting their initials. There were seperate HTML (scores.HTML) and js (scorejava.js) file made for scores and results but was not able to get it do anything.
